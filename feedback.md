### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your instructors will be grading you using this rubric.

For each criterion below, instructors will give you a score according to the following guidelines. "Ticking" all of the boxes for a criterion will earn a "meets expectations".

They will also assign a **Total Score**, to serve as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals. However, __the more important scores are the individual ones__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

| Score | Expectations |
| :---- | :----------- |
| **0** | _Does not meet expectations_ |
| **1** | _Meets expectactions_ |
| **2** | _Exceeds expectations_ |

## Project Workflow - Meets expectations
##### How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?
- The `readme.md` file contains any necessary installation instructions

> :+1: Great job! You can also include gems under technologies used. Devise, Figaro, and Carrierwave in particular. Devise in particular is used everywhere so potential employers love to see experience with it.

- The `planning` folder contains:
  - a picture / screenshot of your ERD (up to date!)
  - a `wireframes` directory, which in turn contains at least 2 drawings or photos of wireframes and ERDs
  - a `user_stories.md` file, which in turn contains at least 7 user stories (or a link to a Trello board or equivalent)

> Awesome! This is also a great resource when interviewing

- A Github issue was submitted to the `project2` repository **by 11:00am on Friday, November 20<sup>th</sup>,** containing a link to a hosted video

> :+1:

- The video itself and/or the site on which it can be found contains a website or e-mail address through which the creator can be contacted

> :+1: The video's really good. You may want to link to it in the readme and link from the video back to the repo/hosted app

- The video is at least 3 minutes long, but **no more than** 5 minutes
- The video contains:
  - A description and demo of the app :+1:
  - A code sample explaining one thing of which the creator is proud :+1:
  - One thing the creator would do differently next time :+1:
  - The next feature the creator would like to implement :+1:

## Technical Requirements - Exceeds Expectations
##### How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?
- The app contains at least 2 models

> Above and beyond! 4 Models including a join table. Clearly implements the fundamentals introduced and then expands upon those. Really great job.

- The app contains at least 1 association

> Several associations including a has many through. App is well modeled to with complexity needed to support functionality and not beyond that.

- At least 1 model incorporates `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes

> :+1: I like that tags don't need their own controller and so that's handled by the cards. Could have add_tag and remove_tag be create and update routes on a small tag controller but the way you have it now works. It's a possible refactor if you add more to tags.

## Creativity / Interface - Exceeds expectations
##### How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?
- The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS

> Very much so. Everything works smoothly and looks good. The Sass is next level.

- The app delivers something of value to the end user: it is not just a login button and an index page

> Absolutely

## Code Quality - Exceeds expectations
##### How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?
- The code follows style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indenting, modularity, and semantic naming

> Beyond being able to reuse and extend this code, someone reading the code here would learn good habits. Don't know where to include how awesome it is that you used tests so it's going here. It's so awesome you used tests! :+1::+1:

- The code is commented only with what is necessary to document what is happening in the code

> :+1:

- For any page, copying its source code as it appears in the **browser** and pasting it into the [W3 Validator](http://validator.w3.org) yields 0 errors

> :+1: been really impressed with your consistency on this. As far as the divs as children elements of labels goes, the rational is [here] (http://stackoverflow.com/a/18609649). As far ways to do the same thing differently, Robin has a lesson plan [here](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/tree/master/10-back-and-front-of-front-end/pseudo-selectors#radio-buttons) with a simple implementation of custom radio buttons. I think it is close to what you're doing. I can also take a look at the tutorial if you send it my way to see if I have another idea.

## Deployment and Functionality - Exceeds expectations
##### How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?
- Cursory use of the app by an uninformed user yields no errors that "break" it

> Couldn't find any errors. Deployed app functions very well

- The app is deployed to Heroku (or another hosting service)

> :+1:

- The contents of the creator's Github repository is identical to that of the Heroku repository

> :+1:

- The `URL` field of the Github repository contains a link to the deployed version of the app

> :+1:
